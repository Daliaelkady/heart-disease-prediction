# Heart Disease Prediction – Machine Learning Project

This project predicts heart disease using supervised learning on the UCI dataset. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, dimensionality reduction (PCA), model training, evaluation, clustering, and deployment readiness.

## 🔍 Features
- EDA and visualization
- PCA for dimensionality reduction
- Trained Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, KNN
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
- Model saved as `.pkl`
- Hierarchical Clustering for unsupervised comparison
- Clean folder structure for deployment
- Ready for GitHub
